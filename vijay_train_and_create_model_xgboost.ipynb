    "## Model Training Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook uses **SageMaker Python SDK V2**\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a machine learning model, we first need **clean and well-prepared data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my repository  👉 **[AI_Learning_DataPrep_SageMaker](https://github.com/VijayBheemineni/AI_Learning_DataPrep_SageMaker)**,  \n",
    "I analyzed the `adult_data.csv` dataset, performed data cleaning and feature transformations, and split the data into three datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training dataset**\n",
    "- **Validation dataset**\n",
    "- **Test dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "All three processed CSV files are stored in **Amazon S3** and are used as inputs for model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Machine Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Once data preparation is complete, the next step is to select an appropriate **machine learning algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, the goal is to predict whether an individual's income is:\n",
    "- `>=50K` or\n",
    "- `<50K`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the output has only **two possible outcomes**, this is a **binary classification problem**.  \n",
    "For this reason, I am using the **XGBoost algorithm**, which is well-suited for structured/tabular data and is commonly used for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens During Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of model training is to create a model that can make accurate predictions on **new, unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **training data** contains both input features and the target label (`income`)\n",
    "- Future data used for predictions **does not contain the target label**\n",
    "\n",
    "During training:\n",
    "- The algorithm learns patterns that map input features to the target\n",
    "- These learned patterns are stored as a **trained ML model**\n",
    "- This model can then be used to predict income categories for new data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters and Model Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to selecting an algorithm, we also configure **hyperparameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters:\n",
    "- Control how the training job runs\n",
    "- Influence model behavior and learning process\n",
    "- Have a significant impact on model performance and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right hyperparameter values is an important part of training an effective model.\n",

    "- **max_depth**: How deep should each decision tree grow? (like deciding how many questions to ask before making a decision)\n",
    "- **learning_rate**: How quickly should the model learn? (too fast and it might miss details, too slow and it takes forever)\n",
    "- **num_round**: How many trees should we build? (more trees can mean better accuracy, but also more computation time)\n",
